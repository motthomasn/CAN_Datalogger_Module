# CAN_Datalogger_Module

Teensy 3.2 based CAN-Bus datalogger designed to recieve data via CAN-Bus and write the raw CAN data to a MicroSD card in binary format. A DBC file and Python script is then used to convert the binary file into CSV format for analysis.

This module was built for my CBR250RRi project but could be configured to work with any CAN-Bus data stream.
